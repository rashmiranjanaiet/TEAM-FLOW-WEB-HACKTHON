# AI Usage Log – Cosmic Watch

This document outlines the usage of AI-assisted tools during the development of **Cosmic Watch**, submitted for the hackathon under the problem statement *Interstellar Asteroid Tracker & Risk Analyser*.

The intent of this log is to ensure transparency, uphold academic integrity, and demonstrate compliance with the hackathon’s rules regarding originality and responsible AI usage.

---

## 1. AI Tools Utilized

- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

---

## 2. Purpose of AI Usage

AI tools were used strictly as a **conceptual aid and learning assistant** to support:
- Understanding of complex problem requirements
- Architectural reasoning
- API comprehension
- General software engineering best practices

AI was **not** used to replace original development, system design decisions, or implementation efforts.

---

## 3. Scope of AI Assistance

### 3.1 Problem Interpretation & Requirement Analysis
AI assistance was used to:
- Interpret the hackathon problem statement
- Translate requirements into structured development goals
- Clarify expectations related to real-time data handling, alert systems, and risk analysis

This helped accelerate understanding but did not influence originality of the solution.

---

### 3.2 System Architecture & Design Discussion
AI was consulted for:
- High-level architectural discussions (frontend–backend separation, modular design)
- Identifying standard architectural patterns suitable for scalable full-stack applications
- Evaluating architectural trade-offs proposed by the team

All architectural decisions were finalized, documented, and implemented independently by the team.

---

### 3.3 External API Understanding (NASA NeoWs)
AI was used as a reference to:
- Understand the structure and semantics of the NASA NeoWs API
- Discuss data normalization strategies
- Identify relevant asteroid parameters (e.g., diameter, velocity, miss distance)

All API integrations, request handling, and data processing logic were written manually.

---

### 3.4 Risk Analysis Conceptual Support
AI assisted in:
- Brainstorming potential factors involved in asteroid risk assessment
- Discussing theoretical approaches to categorizing Near-Earth Objects

The final risk analysis model, scoring logic, thresholds, and classifications were fully designed and implemented by the team without direct AI code generation.

---

### 3.5 UI/UX & Visualization Ideation
AI was used for:
- Non-code dashboard layout inspiration
- Thematic UI ideas (dark mode, space-oriented visuals)
- Conceptual visualization suggestions

All frontend components and visual elements were created through original implementation.

---

### 3.6 Debugging & Knowledge Reinforcement
AI was occasionally referenced to:
- Understand error messages
- Reinforce understanding of frameworks and libraries
- Explore alternative implementation strategies

No AI-generated code was directly copied into the project.

---

## 4. Explicit Non-Usage Declaration

In accordance with the hackathon rules, AI tools were **not** used to:
- Generate complete or partial source code files
- Implement backend or frontend business logic
- Design or write database schemas
- Create Docker or deployment configurations
- Replace original problem-solving or decision-making

All development work was performed during the hackathon timeframe by the team.

---

## 5. Compliance Statement

AI usage in **Cosmic Watch** was limited to **assistance, guidance, and conceptual clarification** only.

The project’s architecture, algorithms, codebase, documentation, and deployment were:
- Independently designed
- Originally implemented
- Fully tested and demonstrated by the team

This submission fully complies with the hackathon’s policies on originality, plagiarism prevention, and responsible AI usage.
